    Thrift Finds #04 A batch of active speakers, door knobs and a transformer

  body: >-
    <p>  <br>I found a set of metal door handles. They could be used to create a form of  body contact , a technique common in circuit bending. Because the handles are conductive, they allow electricity to pass through them. By touching the two handles with my hands, I create a connection between two circuits, turning my body into a human-scale switch.  </p>
